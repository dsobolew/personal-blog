Hi, my name is Dennis Sobolewski and I am a data scientist. I created this site to share my work and hopefully learn along the way. Stay tuned for a more in depth "About me" section in the future, but for now I am just trying to get some posts up. In the meantime, please enjoy a curated gif from my personal collection.
